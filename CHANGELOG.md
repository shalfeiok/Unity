# CHANGELOG

## 2026-02-28
- Added PlayMode smoke coverage `UITogglesSmokeTest` for hotkey-intent panel toggles (I/C/P/S/K/O/M) via `UIHotkeyRouter` + windowing runtime, including Atlas mapping and injectable bindings (`IUIHotkeyBindings` / `DefaultUIHotkeyBindings`).
- Added PlayMode smoke scenario that stitches hotbar assignment, passive allocation, and craft preview/commit into one service-level vertical loop.
- Added top-level project reports: `SUMMARY_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`, `SYSTEM_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`, `BALANCE_GUIDELINES.md`.
